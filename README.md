# Inverse-Kinematics

<p>
This is the implementation of FABRIK and PSO algorithm to solve inverse kinematics.
</p>
<h2>
FABRIK
</h2>
<p>
It is implemented without axis constraint for all the joints.
</p>

<h2>
Particle Swarm Optimization
</h2>
<p>
The current implementation uses the standard 4 dof robotic arm. By changing the FK used in the evaluate method, it can be used for any arm.
